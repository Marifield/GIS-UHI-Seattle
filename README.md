## Description
As the global urban population continues to grow, the proportion of the urban population currently stands at 57% (Kaneda et al., PRB 2022), and will continue to grow to 60% by 2030. Huge urban populations further promote more large-scale building construction. This unstoppable tendency of urbanization has caused undesired effects around the world. Urban heat island (UHI) as one of these causes can be traced back to Luke Howard's observations in 1818, in the article Howard observed that the temperature of London was higher than that of the surrounding countryside. He attributed this to the heat generated by the population, as well as the geometry and materials of the urban surfaces, which trapped and reflected heat. He also noted that the urban effect varied with the seasons, the winds, and the moisture (Mills G, 2008).
